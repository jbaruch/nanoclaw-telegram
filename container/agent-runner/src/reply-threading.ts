/**
 * reply-threading — pure decision logic for the
 * `reply-threading-enforcement` PreToolUse hook (#137).
 *
 * When a user sends a message and AyeAye starts working on it, the
 * agent sometimes mid-turn emits a `send_message` **without
 * `reply_to`** — a standalone message that lands at the bottom of the
 * chat instead of as a quoted reply. In active threads (multiple
 * users, parallel topics) this looks like AyeAye answering a different
 * question, or talking to itself.
 *
 * The intended runtime contract is "single-turn": within the agent
 * loop, after a user inbound is recorded as the latest, the FIRST
 * `send_message` to that chat must thread to it (or be flagged as a
 * pin / dedicated-bot persona). Subsequent calls in the same turn can
 * be standalone — by then the inbound is "addressed".
 *
 * Cross-turn de-duplication (the "bot already spoke since this
 * inbound" carve-out for multi-user chats) is intentionally out of
 * scope for this initial cut. Doing it right requires a SQL query
 * against the mounted `messages.db`, which adds a native sqlite
 * dependency to the agent-runner and a container rebuild. The
 * in-process single-turn check catches the recurring "standalone
 * mid-turn" bug class without that footprint.
 *
 * Kept SDK-free so the root vitest can exercise it without spinning
 * up `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.
