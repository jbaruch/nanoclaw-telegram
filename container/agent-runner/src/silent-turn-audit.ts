/**
 * silent-turn-audit — pure decision logic for the
 * `stop-hook-end-of-turn-audit` Stop hook (#142).
 *
 * The most insidious AyeAye failure mode: user sends a message, the
 * agent runs a turn, does work, exits — but never reacts to or
 * replies to the user's actual message. From the user's view it looks
 * like dropped silence; from the orchestrator's view the container
 * exited cleanly. There is no signal that anything went wrong unless
 * the user notices and complains.
 *
 * The hook is **observability only** — it does not block the turn.
 * On Stop, it inspects per-turn state collected during the run and,
 * if the triggering inbound was neither reacted to nor replied to,
 * appends a structured entry to `/workspace/host-logs/silent-turns.log`
 * for later investigation.
 *
 * Pure decomposition:
 *  - `createSilentTurnState()` — fresh state per runQuery.
 *  - `decideSilentTurnAudit({...})` — given the gathered state and
 *    skip flags, returns either `pass` (do nothing) or `log` (write
 *    the audit entry).
 *
 * Wiring lives in `index.ts`: PreToolUse callbacks update the state
 * for `react_to_message` / `send_message`; the Stop callback consults
 * `decideSilentTurnAudit` and writes the log file.
 *
 * Kept SDK-free so the root vitest can exercise it without spinning
 * up `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.
