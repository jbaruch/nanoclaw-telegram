# Full NanoClaw deployment — single command, no manual steps.
#
# Usage: ssh nas "cd ~/nanoclaw && ./scripts/deploy.sh"
#    or: ssh nas "cd ~/nanoclaw && ./scripts/deploy.sh --tiles-only"
#
# Steps:
#   1. Pull latest code from origin
#   2a. Rebuild agent-runner image (must precede 2b — see #69)
#   2b. Rebuild orchestrator image (`docker compose up -d --build`
#       recreates the running container as a side effect of the rebuild)
#   3. Update tiles from registry
#   4. Clear runtime skill overrides from all groups
#   5. Kill ALL running agent containers (forces fresh tile load)
#   6. Clear ALL sessions from DB
#   7. Restart orchestrator
#
# The --tiles-only flag skips the git pull and image rebuilds (for when
# only tile content changed, not source code).

# Read CONTAINER_IMAGE from .env if it isn't already set in the shell,
# so this script and `docker compose` see the same source of truth.
# `docker compose` reads .env directly when interpolating
# `${CONTAINER_IMAGE:-...}`; without this lookup, a `.env`-only setting
# would be visible to compose but invisible to this script — silent
# divergence, "we rebuild what the orchestrator spawns" stops being
# true.
#
# Two design choices worth preserving:
#   1. Parse `.env` as data, NOT `source .env`. Sourcing executes the
#      file as shell code — any unexpected/malicious content runs on
#      the host. We only want one specific KEY=VALUE, not arbitrary
#      shell.
#   2. Shell-exported values WIN over `.env`. That matches `docker
#      compose`'s precedence (shell env overrides .env). Without this
#      check, `set -a + source .env` would overwrite an explicit shell
#      export — operator surprise.

    # `grep -m1` stops after the first match — a single tool, no `head`
    # pipe (which would close stdin and hand grep a SIGPIPE under
    # `set -o pipefail`). `|| true` swallows the no-match exit-1 so a
    # `.env` that doesn't define CONTAINER_IMAGE leaves us at the
    # default rather than aborting the script under `set -e`.
    # Strip surrounding double or single quotes if present, the way
    # compose's .env parser does.

    # 2. Rebuild agent-runner + orchestrator.

    # the ORCHESTRATOR. The reverse order leaves a window where the new
    # orchestrator is live but `nanoclaw-agent:latest` still points at
    # the pre-deploy image — any inbound message in that window spawns
    # an agent from the stale image (issue #69, the same stale-image
    # class of bug as #66 was meant to close).
    #
    # Doing agent first means: while build.sh runs, the OLD orchestrator
    # is still serving requests against the OLD agent image — i.e. the
    # pre-deploy steady state, not a regression. By the time the
    # orchestrator is recreated by `docker compose up -d --build`, the
    # agent image is already new.
    #
    # Orchestrator image bakes the host-side TypeScript compiled output;
    # agent-runner image bakes container-side source (MCP tools, IPC
    # bridge). Both need rebuilding after a source-code pull — previous
    # versions of this script only built the orchestrator, which left
    # the agent image stale (last observed when `nuke_session` got a
    # new `session` parameter on the schema: the schema was in git but
    # AyeAye's container still saw the old parameterless tool until
    # someone remembered to run `./container/build.sh` separately).
