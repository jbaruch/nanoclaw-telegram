 *
 * Mirrors `unlinkJsonlInSlug` with the same lstat → branch on type →
 * realpath-containment discipline; only the leaf operation differs.
 *
 *   - **Symlink**: unlink the symlink itself. `fs.unlinkSync` removes
 *     the link entry without following it, so a compromised container
 *     can't redirect the wipe to walk into an arbitrary host directory
 *     and `recursive: true` it. Same "nuke really nukes" promise as
 *     the JSONL path.
 *
 *   - **Directory**: realpath the dir and the slug, verify the dir's
 *     real path is inside the slug's real path, then `fs.rmSync` with
 *     `recursive: true`. Node's `rmSync` does NOT traverse symlinks
 *     it encounters inside the tree — they're removed as link entries,
 *     never followed — so a malicious container that drops a symlink
 *     to `/etc` inside its own tool-results dir cannot trick us into
 *     deleting host files. The realpath check guards the parent path
 *     itself against ancestor-symlink swap (TOCTOU between the outer
 *     `wipeSessionJsonl` lstat and this call).
 *
 *   - **Regular file at the dir path**: not something the SDK writes,
 *     but if a compromised container plants one we leave it alone and
 *     log — wiping it would be outside the helper's contract (it's a
 *     directory remover) and could mask whatever produced the file.

 * Wipe the on-disk session artifacts (JSONL transcript and the

 * Returns the total number of filesystem entries removed.
 *
 * The function name retains the historical "Jsonl" suffix from when it
 * only unlinked transcripts; the contract is now a full session-artifact
 * wipe. Both artifact types share one realpath-containment regime, one
 * DoS-cap regime, and one slug-walk traversal — keeping them in a single
 * function avoids walking `projects/` twice for what is conceptually one
 * "wipe everything tied to this sessionId" operation.
 *
 * Production callers:
 *   1. `nukeSession` (#100) — owns the multi-step order-of-operations
 *      wipe (capture sessionIds → kill containers → drop DB rows →
 *      remove session artifacts).
 *   2. `startSchedulerLoop` (#193) — injects this as a dependency so
 *      `runTask`'s post-run finally can wipe the per-run artifacts the
 *      moment a scheduled run completes (its sessionId is never
 *      persisted to the DB, so the time-based `cleanup-sessions.sh`
 *      can't find them later).
 *
 * Tests also import this symbol directly to bypass the full
 * `nukeSession` path.
 *
 * @internal — the orchestrator builds with `tsconfig.stripInternal: true`,
 * so this tag keeps the symbol out of the emitted `.d.ts`. The two
 * production callers above are in-tree and don't need d.ts visibility;
 * tests reach the symbol through the source `.ts` import, not the d.ts.
